You have intercepted a coded message.  
  
Your objective is to identify the source of the material.  
  
You can see from the character encoding of the HTML document that the encoded message is in Unicode. You have also received intelligence that the original message is in English and that it only uses a very simple cipher, wherein every letter is shifted forward by the same number of characters.  

Hints  

* Python 3 uses unicode by default; as such you may find it easier to solve this using Python 3.
* What is the most common word in the English language?
* Don't worry if your decryption isn't perfect; identifying the text is what's important here.
* If you don't recognise the text, Google is your friend.
